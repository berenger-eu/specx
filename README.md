# Introduction
SPETABARU is a task-based runtime system, which is
capable of executing tasks in advance if some others are not certain to modify
the data.

The project was originally designed for Monte Carlo and
Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (RMC/Parallel tempering).

This is an on-going project under development.


# Examples

Several examples are given in the `Example` directory.
